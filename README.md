# Rss-feed-Apache-indexing

Hey everybody!
This project is just a simple Rss feed generator for Apache indexed web server.
I have tested it on a Raspberry Pi Model 3 with Raspbian Buster on it.

For the best reproducibility, it is better you are:
- root on your machine
- using Apache Web Server 2.4 with Indexes enabled for your files and directories
- NOT using a self signed SSK/TLS certificate for your web server


As said above, it is just a little thing I have created for personal use, but I think it could be useful for anyone else.
